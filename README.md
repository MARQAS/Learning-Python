<strong>Modules [modules.py]</strong>
Modules are code libraries that can contain functions we can call from our code. They make our life easier by implementing the hard stuff for us.
All the modules does not come pre-installed with Python, so we'll have to install it. Pip is a package manager that will install modules for us.
Example: pip install Name of the module
* requests module

<strong>Custom Modules:[circus.py & weather.py] </strong>
A script containing definitions is a module and can be imported by a script or another module
We can use 'import module_name' as long as they are in the same directory
